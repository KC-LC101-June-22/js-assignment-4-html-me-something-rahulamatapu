            Nadal has an aggressive, behind-the-baseline playing style built on heavy topspin groundstrokes, consistency, speedy footwork and 
            total court coverage. He uses a full western grip forehand, which is tough to beat given the topspin. 
            He leads the grandslam race with the most titles in the men's circuit.

            Federer is fundamentally an offensive player. This is what makes him very exciting to watch--he takes risks to create opportunities 
            to hit winners. He displays a lot of creativity on the court (backed by an extraordinary amount of talent)
             and is generally considered an "all-court" player.

            To me, his style of play would be what I believe is called an aggressive counter puncher. This plays to his greatest strengths, 
            consistency, fitness, a really strong defence. He is able to get a lot of balls back, at a great length, outlast his opponents 
            during rallies.

            Serena plays with a two-handed backhand and uses an open stance for her groundstrokes. She is known for her precise ball placement and
             quick footwork. Serena is also known for her unexpected comebacks, occasionally executing long slides and splits to reach the ball and win the point.

            Graf was a unique tennis athlete, the first and last of her kind. 
            Standing at 5'10”, she was slender but powerful. 
            Best of all for her tennis, she had strong legs and gazelle-like 
            footwork that retrieved tough balls and allowed her to blast her forehand.

          <p>
            Murray has one of the best, if not the best, double-handed backhand in the game. What makes it a strength is that his backhand is very consistent; 
            he varies it very well and can hit it with a lot of pace when needed.
            His backhand down the line is a shot to be feared by his opponents.

          <p>
            Navratilova was an obsessive attacker who spent a majority of her time at the net. 
            She used her lefty serve and crisp volleys to control rallies and time away from her opponents. 
            Navratilova had a one-handed backhand, which she sliced on most occasions.

          <p>
            Endowed with a preternatural sense for finding the pattern of play that most disrupted his opponent’s rhythm, 
            Sampras could strip the emotion out of the occasion and conjure his best tennis at the most important times. 
            Even today, if you had one point to save your life, you would probably want him playing it.

          <p>
            Andre was an aggressive player, just not in the mold of many of today's players. Andre had relatively flat, 
            penetrating groundstrokes. He took the ball very early, which cut down on his opponent's time. 
            And he changed direction (of the ball) extremely well and controlled the middle of the court.

            McEnroe's game combined shot-making artistry, deft volleys, and a fast, attacking style of play. 
            His sharp reflexes enabled him to return the biggest serves and passing shots masterfully, and the variety, 
            delicacy, and quickness of his play delighted crowds.

            Billie Jean King played aggressively, hit her ground strokes with a purpose, and was a tenacious net player. 
            Her court speed was exceptional, and her competitiveness was the edge that
             earned her a 695-155 (82 percent) record in singles and an 87-37 mark in doubles. 
            King's all-court game made her an ideal doubles partner.
